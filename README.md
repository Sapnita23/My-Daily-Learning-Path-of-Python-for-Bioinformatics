Variables and Data types
Variable-variable is like a container that holds data, it is like creating a placeholder in memory and assigning it some values.
a=1 (integer)
b=True (boolean)
c="Sapnita" (string)
d=None (none)
Data type-
Data type specifies the type of value a variable holds. This is required in programming to do various operations without causing an error.
In python, we can print the type of any operator using type function:
a=1
print(type(a))
b=1
print(type(b))
complex number can also be made in python-complex numbers are the numbers with real part& imaginary part
a=complex(8,2)
Sequenced data:list, tuple
List: A list ia an ordered collection of data with elements seperated by a comma and enclosed within square brackets.  Lists are mutable and can be modified after creation.
collection of different data types. It is mutable
Eg-list1=[8,2.3, [-4, 5], ["apple", "banana"]]
Tuple: A tuple is an ordered collection of data with elementsseperated by a comma and enclosed within paratheses. Tuples are immutable and cannot be modified after creation.
Ex- tuple1=(("parrot", "sparrow"), ("Lion", "Tiger"))
Mapped data-dictionary
dict: Collection of key value pairs,
dictionary is a mapped data
**IN PYTHON EVERYTHING IS A OBJECT**
OPERATORS
Python has different types of operators for different operations. To create a calculator arithmetic operators are required
